# CS-360


This program required a typical log-in system that could create new accounts as well as log into current ones. It was also important to 
build a feature that uses SMS notifications and displays a dialog asking the user for rights at the proper moment.
The user's requirements for this app were the ability to register their daily weight, see a history of daily weights,
delete or change specific daily weight entries, and receive a notice when they reached their weight goal.
To meet these user demands, a log-in page and a weight monitoring panel were added to the UI. I modeled my log-in screen 
after current log-in panels so that users would be comfortable with the procedure for utilizing the login function. In this
way, my user interface design met the user's expectations.
I believe that I best demonstrated my knowledge and skill by implementing the log-in screen and the Room database that is 
the backend for the app. The design of the log-in screen shows my understanding of creating Android Studio layouts and the 
implementation shows my understanding of how the relationship between XML units and Java objects works in the Android Run Time's
Document Object Model (DOM). My implemenation of the Room database also shows a good understanding of how to construct SQL queries, 
populate database tables and how to properly use annotation tags to utilize non-traditional libraries like Room.
